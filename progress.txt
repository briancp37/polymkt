## 2026-01-06: Bootstrap Import Feature Implementation

### What was done:
Implemented the foundational bootstrap import feature which reads existing poly_data CSV files and converts them to a professional DuckDB-over-Parquet analytics stack.

### Features implemented:
1. **Bootstrap CSV to Parquet pipeline** (`src/polymkt/pipeline/bootstrap.py`)
   - Reads markets.csv, trades.csv, orderFilled.csv from data/ directory
   - Converts to Parquet with ZSTD compression
   - Proper schema with typed columns (timestamps as UTC datetime, numerics as float64)
   - Column renaming from camelCase to snake_case

2. **DuckDB view layer** (`src/polymkt/storage/duckdb_layer.py`)
   - Creates v_markets, v_trades, v_order_filled, v_trades_with_markets views
   - v_trades_with_markets includes days_to_exp derived field
   - Query interface with market_id and time range filters

3. **Metadata store** (`src/polymkt/storage/metadata.py`)
   - SQLite-backed run history tracking
   - Stores run_id, start/end time, rows read/written, schema version
   - Watermark persistence for incremental updates

4. **FastAPI endpoints** (`src/polymkt/api/main.py`)
   - POST /api/bootstrap - Run bootstrap import
   - GET /api/runs - List pipeline runs
   - GET /api/runs/{run_id} - Get run details
   - POST /api/query/trades - Query trades with filters
   - GET /api/watermarks - Get current watermarks
   - GET /health - Health check

### PRD features marked as passing:
- Bootstrap from existing backfilled poly_data CSVs
- Convert backfilled trades.csv into compressed Parquet
- Create DuckDB database layer with views over Parquet
- Maintain metadata store for run history and watermarks

### Tech stack:
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI for API
- DuckDB for analytics queries
- PyArrow for Parquet operations
- Pydantic for data validation
- SQLite for metadata storage

### Tests:
12 tests passing covering bootstrap, API, and query functionality.
Type checking passes with mypy.

### Next steps for future sessions:
- Implement schema validation for custom columns (category, closedTime, tags)
- Implement incremental updates with watermark-based fetching
- Add Parquet partitioning for query optimization
- Implement the search indices (BM25 + vector search)
